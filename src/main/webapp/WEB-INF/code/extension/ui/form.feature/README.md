### HTML Rendering

You have already seen how I can highlight your fenced code blocks. See the [Fenced Code Block](#fenced-code-block) section if you haven’t!

I can also render TeX-like math syntaxes, if you allow me to.[^6] I can do inline math like this: \\( 1 + 1 \\) or this (in MathML): <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>, and block math:[^5]

\\[
    A^T_S = B
\\]

or (in MathML)

<math display="block">
    <msubsup><mi>A</mi> <mi>S</mi> <mi>T</mi></msubsup>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mi>B</mi>
</math>


[^6]: Internet connection required.


## Editor Options

You can customize the editor to you liking in the **Editor** preferences pane:

### Styling

My editor provides syntax highlighting. You can edit the base font and the coloring/sizing theme. I provided some default themes (courtesy of [Mou](http://mouapp.com)’s creator, Chen Luo) if you don’t know where to start.

You can also edit, or even add new themes if you want to! Just click the ***Reveal*** button, and start moving things around. Remember to use the correct file extension (`.styles`), though. I’m picky about that.


### Behaviors

I offer auto-completion and other functions to ease your editing experience. If you don’t like it, however, you can turn them off.


## Hack On

That’s about it. Thanks for listening. I’ll be quiet from now on (unless there’s an update about the app—I’ll remind you for that!).

Happy writing!
